Source code of the future home of the ScalaFX home page. To preview go to

Build with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Based on [Jekyll site code](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).

To build the site locally use command:

     bundle exec jekyll serve --safe --watch

Using `bundle exec jekyll ...` rather than simply `jekyll` is closer to the way 
GitHub will build it. It can help detect certain build issues.
